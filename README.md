Welcome to my home assignment!<br>
CI/CD Pipeline flow created in order to deploy the python web app based flask.

2 Releases with different version of the app are available<br>
To switch between versions change Release between 1 and 2 in file activate_release.yml<br>

Note: By changing the code and run git push in current github the webhook sent to Jenkins Pipeline<br>
Jenkins running ansible code and adding the app inside the docker and then exposing the port 5000 to the world<br>

Link to Web App: http://ec2-35-157-131-255.eu-central-1.compute.amazonaws.com:5000<br>

Good Luck<br>
